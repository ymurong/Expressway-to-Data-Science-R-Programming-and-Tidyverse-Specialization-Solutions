### Introduction

Reference the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) while completing the exercises. 

These exercises are ungraded.

```{r lib, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
```

#### Question 1. 

Using the nycflights13 data, calculate a new variable called "hr_delay" and arrange the flights dataset in order of the arrival delays in hours (longest delays at the top). Put the new variable you created just before the departure time. Hint: use the experimental argument .before. 

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(hr_delay = arr_delay / 60 + dep_delay / 60 ) %>%
  arrange(desc(arr_delay)) %>%
  relocate(hr_delay, .before = dep_time)
```
#### Question 2. 

What proportion of flights in nycflights13 are delayed by more than on hour? 

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter((arr_delay+dep_delay)/60>1) %>%
  nrow() / nrow(flights)
```
